# reactapp-w-auth0

Just me learning how to use React, Flux, and Auth0.

Please update react-auth-server/server.js and src/component/App.js with your AUTH0 creds

npm i **in root and in react-auth-server folder**
nodemon react-auth-server/server.js **Starts Simple Express API**
npm start **Runs App**
